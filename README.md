# SubWoa Personal Website

A minimalist single-page personal website highlighting experience, featured projects, writing, and contact information.

## Getting Started

Open `index.html` in your favourite browser. No build tooling or dependencies are required.

## Customising

- Update the hero headline, subtitle, and call-to-action text directly within `index.html`.
- Replace the sample projects and writing entries in `index.html` with your own content.
- Modify colours, typography, or layout tokens in `assets/style.css` to make the design your own.
- Swap the email address and social links in the contact section with your real details.

Enjoy your new home on the web! âœ¨
